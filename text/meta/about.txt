Paragon is a world that I composed by joining fantasies of
worlds, its habitants, and their history. What makes paragon
unique is how the nature of the world blends and contributes
to the story. Sure, fire elemental magic is good for combat,
but have you ever tried baking bread with it? Or inventing a 
new type of stained glassware? Humans are resourceful in their
innovation, using their environment in clever ways. The
lore of your fantasies should reflect that.

This text adventure game is a glimpse into the world I've
travelled and the people I've met. Every story is crafted
with care for the world and its greater artistic meaning.

Remember that fantasy is ultimately based on the human
experience. I hope that your feelings and reflections on
your experiences of this game cultivate a deeper appreciate
for the real world.
